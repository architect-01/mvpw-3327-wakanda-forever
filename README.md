# Introduction

This is a solution to the MVPW 3327 Wakanda Forever assignment. Goal of which is to build a decentralized
voting system using the blockchain to provide for fair elections.

The citizens of Wakanda can register using their ETH address and receive 1 WKND token that can be used to
vote for one of the candidates in the Wakanda UN Election.

WKND token is an ERC20 token - which means it can be transfered between different addresses and multiple votes
can come from one address.

Three candidates with the highest number of votes will be elected as the Wakanda's UN representatives.

The detailed assignment info is available at: **[3327] Wakanda.pdf**

# Solution's approach

Have a server as the intermediary that will pass signed messages (generated by the front end) to the smart contracts (SC) which will
then verify the signature and act accordingly.

## Folder structure

The solution is structured like this:

- **smart-contracts** :
  Used for developing, testing and deploying smart contracts using "brownie" framework.
- **website** :
  NodeJS Express backend with React frontend.
- **CONFIG.json** :
  Common constants seen across the solution.

## Smart Contracts

The contracts are stored in the: _smart-contracts/contracts_

The two main are : **Token.sol** and **Voting.sol**

### Token.sol

Is an ERC20 token with three additional public functions :

- **setAuthority (address \_authority)**
  - Called by the King (contract's deployer) to set the address that will be able to manipulate with the voter' balances - this is the address of the Voting.sol contract.
- **usingRegistrationRight (address \_voter, uint256 \_value)**
  - Called by the Voting contract when there is a register call. It transfers to the _\_voter_ the registration amount (_\_value_).
- **usingVotingRight(address \_voter, uint256 \_value)**
  - Called by the Voting contract when there is a vote call. It burns the amount of tokens provided (_\_value_) - To disable the possibility of multiple votes being cast using the same tokens.

### Voting.sol

Is a custom smart contract that fascilates the requirements that are listed in the assignment.

The most interesting part of this SC is the:

- **delegatedVote (bytes calldata signature, address citizenAddress, uint256 candidateId, uint256 amount)**
  - Which takes the _signature_ generated by another address (not the one calling the SC function) and determines if the message was signed by the _citizenAddress_ as well as if the corresponding parts of the message (_candidateId_ and _amount_) are the same. If so, it proceeds to cast the vote for the right candidate.

## Website

NodeJS (ExpressJS) server as backend and ReactJS as frontend framework. Located in : _website_ folder.

## General development flow

After making changes to .sol files.
Use the command : **\*cd smart-contracts && brownie run scripts/deploy_all.py --network NETWORK_NAME \***
which deploys all contracts and updates the _website/DeployedContracts_ folder for the backend to use.

# Requirements

- smart-contracts:
  - Brownie 1.16.4 [pip install eth-brownie]
- website:
  - NodeJS v13.12.0 and NPM 6.14.4
  - NPM modules listed in "website/package.json"[cd website && npm install]
  - NPM modules listed in "website/client/package.json" [cd website/client && npm install]

# Some important information

- The verification of signed messages fails on the local network but passes on the Rinkeby network.
